This repo has been created to help you to adopt **Go** and learn about it

[Spanish - (Blog) IntroducciÃ³n a Go o Golang](https://geeks.ms/jorge/2021/01/15/introduccion-a-go-o-golang/)


# Features of **Go**

Some of the most important features of **Go** are:

- manages the memory for us
- has been created thinking in the concurrency paradigm
- compile to standalone binaries (not interpreted)
- is fast in compilation times (giving us a quick feedback about errors or problems)
- is simple to use
- is strongly typed
- is statically typed 


# First steps

If you have not installed *Go* on your computer, please... follow this steps

1) [**Download Go**](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2) Install it!
3) Open your terminal or command prompt and write

``` go
go version
```

You should see information about **Go** and the version installed on your computer 

## **Go** file extension

All your Go files should have the extension **.go**

For example:

``` Go
main.go
```

## Basic **Go** commands

There are a lot of commands inside of *Go*

The basic commands that you will be use for sure are:

* To execute your code:

``` Go
go run main.go
```

* To build your code in a standalone binary:

``` Go
go build
```


## Write you own **Go** programs!

Use some editor to create or modify the samples

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a good tool to do it

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ins another very good tool (*is the tool that I use really*)

The most important here is to use the tool that you want and to be comfortable with it

One important thing here

> **If you want to use Visual Code as me, don't forget install the [*Go for Visual Studio Code extension*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go)** *This extension for Visual Studio Code is not necessary but helps*

But if you want to run your *Go* code without install anything... you can!

You can test your *Go* code in the official web site, or in [*Go Playround* directly](https://play.golang.org/)
